Question 1:
    a. How you create a fraction in Python?
        First, you need to import the fraction module using: from fractions import Fraction
        then, you can specify the fraction by using the Fraction function like so: 
            x = Fraction(1,3)

    b. What function converts a number to a binary
    notation?
        bin()

    c. What function do you use to change the way a
    floating point value is displayed?
        format()

    d. What function allows you to create imaginary
    numbers?
        complex()

    e. What the NumPy library can do, other than create
    arrays?
       it can provide multidimensional array objects, various derived objects (such as masked arrays and matrices),
       and an assortment of routines for fast operations on arrays, including mathematical, logical, shape manipulation,
       sorting, selecting, I/O, discrete Fourier transforms, basic linear algebra, basic statistical operations, random simulation and much more. 

Question 2: Answer the following questions:
    a. Is there a limit on how many statements I can
    place in an if or else code block
    No, the only limit is your patience.

    b. Is there a limit on how many elif statements I
    can place in an if statement
     the limit should be the same as the limit for code size in general,
     in other words so big you'll practically never reach it.

    c. Which is the greater string:
        1)
            [] i. “Hello”
            [x] ii. “Goodbye"
            [] iii. "hello"
            [] iv. "HELLO"
        2) Explain your answer
            Goodbye since it has more charactes and the most of lowercase letters with
            the highest value.
            G   o   o   d   b   y   e
            71  111 111 100 98  121 101 = 613
